Subject: [Lazybones-devel] [Bug #15784] LazyBones fetch information about
	Recordings permanent
Message-ID: <200905311641.n4VGfrmh023165@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #15784, was updated on 2009-May-31 18:41
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: Lazy Bones
Category: LazyBones
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: None
Priority: 5
Submitted by: tomdebian
Assigned to : none
Summary: LazyBones fetch information about Recordings permanent

Details: LazyBones fetch information about Recordings after nearly every operation, sometimes also without cause.

Some details:

I have about 2500 recordings on my vdr-system and normally about 30-50 (mostly auto generated) timers.
At every start LazyBones fetch information about all Recording, which need about 12 minutes. During that time, I cannot use LazyBones and only some of the other features of tvbrowser. This is annoying and starts with the actual version 0.5.3.2. 

If I want (after waiting until LazyBones has finished) to schedule a new record, it works as usual. But then it starts (not always) fetching all  information about all Recordings again. Also if vdr acutally records.

Is there a way to do this job in a separate thread, so I can use LazyBones just normally? Or to disable this feature - I don't use it.

Comment:
In the last version I changed the method of loading the recording information from lazy loading to immediate loading.

2500 recordings are a lot. I never expected that someone has so many recordings 8-O. So, lazy loading is the better approach and I switched back to it with an config option to enable the immediate loading of the recording details.

Check out version 0.5.3.3.
